1. Enter the Concurrent users and
2. Choose Transactions per hour (TPH) rate or Transactions Per Second (TPS) rate as per your project requirement.
3. Click on the Submit button.
4. The pacing value in seconds and minutes will be displayed.
 
The pacing value displayed here is the sum of think times (in between the scripts) and pacing between iterations that need to be configured.
in our scripts to achieve the required TPH for the given concurrent users.
 
Kind Note: 1. Kindly click on clear to clear the existing values before attempting next iteration of calculation
           2. The utility has not been subjected to negative testing.
 
Hope this utility is helpful to all Performance test engineers.
